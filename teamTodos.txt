- pick out a best feature selection method of each model (linear (ridge), tree-based (random forest/Extratree), XGboost/lightGBM)

- Feature selection / engineering redesign

- may try create momentum features myself (target.shift(1,5)) [done]

- modify WalkForwardCV to allow it compatible with multi-model

- standardization

- feature generations

- PCA
